Image classification is a computer vision task that involves assigning a label or category to an input image based on its visual content. This is typically achieved by training a machine learning algorithm, such as a neural network, on a labeled dataset of images. Once the algorithm is trained, it can be used to predict the label of new, unseen images. Image classification has many practical applications, such as identifying objects in photos, recognizing faces, and detecting diseases in medical images.
